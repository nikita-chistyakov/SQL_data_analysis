# Exploratory Data Analysis in SQL 

As part of the SQL journey to explore a database and the data in it, I accessed and built on basic functions of joining tables, grouping data, and using subqueries. Using data from Stack Overflow, Fortune 500 companies, and 311 help requests  from Evanston, IL, I first got familiar with numeric, character, and date/time data types. I used  functions to aggregate, summarize, and analyze data without leaving  the database.




## Features

- Join/innet JOIN
- Computing the averages
- Correlation
- Trimming
- Custom aggregation periods





## Lessons Learned

Errors and inconsistencies in the data are common problems, so I developed strategies to clean up messy data. I explored this project using the PostgreSQL database.
